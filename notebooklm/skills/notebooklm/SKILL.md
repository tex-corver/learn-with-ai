# NotebookLM - Expert Knowledge to Action

Turn any expert's content into a personalized protocol with experiments you actually run. Load 300 YouTube episodes into NotebookLM from terminal, run a cited interview about your goal, create experiments in your Obsidian daily note.

**Video walkthrough:** [https://youtu.be/KRpZSvtMiTI](https://youtu.be/KRpZSvtMiTI)

## What This Does

1. **Load sources from terminal.** You can't just tell NotebookLM to add a YouTube channel. This skill does it. One command. 300 episodes.
2. **Cited answers traced to exact transcript lines.** Every recommendation links back to the exact episode and passage. Verifiable.
3. **Expert-informed interviews.** Claude queries NotebookLM with YOUR goal. Generates questions informed by the expert's research on your specific topic.
4. **Experiments in Obsidian.** Protocol becomes experiments in your daily note. Morning routine skill asks every day: how is this going?
5. **Any expert, any domain.** Huberman for health. Lenny for product. Onboarding docs for a new job. Same pattern.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install nlm CLI

```bash
uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli
```

Gives you the `nlm` command. See [notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli) for details.

### 2. Install notebooklm-py (for notebook creation and channel loading)

```bash
pip install "notebooklm-py[browser]"
playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
# nlm CLI auth (for queries and source listing)
nlm auth login

# notebooklm-py auth (for notebook creation and loading)
notebooklm login
```

Both open a browser window for Google login. `nlm` saves to its own config, `notebooklm-py` saves cookies to `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json`.

### 4. Obsidian Plugins

- **Dataview** (required) - for dashboard queries and citation tables

## Quick Start

```bash
# List your notebooks
nlm notebook list

# Ask a question with citations
nlm notebook query <notebook-id> "What does Huberman say about deep focus?" --json

# List sources
nlm source list <notebook-id> --json
```

## Workflow Routing

| User says | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| "load channel", "youtube channel", "bulk load videos" | [workflows/youtube-channel.md](workflows/youtube-channel.md) |
| "notebooklm ask", "ask notebook", "Q&A" | [workflows/ask.md](workflows/ask.md) |
| "import notebook", "import sources" | [workflows/import.md](workflows/import.md) |
| "notebooklm auth", "notebooklm login" | [workflows/auth.md](workflows/auth.md) |

## The Full Pipeline

This is the workflow shown in the video:

### 1. Pick your expert and goal

```
Goal: "I want to improve my health and focus"
Expert: Andrew Huberman (@hubaborhab on YouTube)
```

### 2. Load their content

```bash
# Scrape channel videos
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/notebooklm/scripts/load_channel.py scrape \
  --channel "https://www.youtube.com/@hubaborhab" \
  --output /tmp/huberman-videos.json

# Create notebook
notebooklm create "Andrew Huberman - Health"

# Load 200 most recent health-related episodes
notebooklm use <notebook-id>
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/notebooklm/scripts/load_channel.py load \
  --videos /tmp/huberman-videos.json \
  --notebook <notebook-id> \
  --count 200 \
  --concurrency 20
```

### 3. Ask expert-informed questions

```bash
nlm notebook query <notebook-id> \
  "What does Huberman recommend for sustaining deep focus for 4+ hours daily?" --json
```

Each answer comes with `[N]` citations back to the exact source and passage.

### 4. Run a cited interview

Claude uses the notebook to generate interview questions specific to YOUR goal. You answer honestly. Claude builds a personalized protocol where each recommendation is tied to an exact episode.

### 5. Create experiments

The protocol becomes experiments in your Obsidian vault:
- Each experiment has a hypothesis, protocol, success criteria, and timeframe
- They appear in your daily note every morning
- Your morning routine skill asks: "How is this experiment going? Any observations?"

### 6. Turn it into a reusable skill

Package the workflow as a `/huberman` or `/lenny` skill. Same pattern, different expert.

## Vault Structure

```
Your Vault/
├── Notes/NotebookLM/
│   ├── Huberman Health.md              # type: notebook (index)
│   └── huberman-health/
│       ├── Sources/                     # type: notebook-source (transcripts)
│       │   └── Episode Title.md
│       └── QA/                          # type: nlm-query (cited answers)
│           └── 2026-04-05 Focus Protocol.md
├── Notes/Experiments/
│   └── Morning Sunlight Protocol.md     # type: experiment
└── Notes/Dashboards/
    └── Health.md                        # Dashboard with embedded experiments
```

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/load_channel.py` | Scrape YouTube channel + bulk-load into NotebookLM |
| `scripts/resolve_citations.py` | Replace `[N]` with `[[Source#^anchor\|[N]]]` wikilinks |
| `scripts/import_sources.py` | Import sources as vault files with metadata |
| `scripts/extract_passages.py` | Extract cited passages from Q&A into source files |
| `scripts/backfill_fulltext.py` | Fetch full transcripts for source files |

All scripts use `Path.cwd()` as vault root. Run them from your vault directory.

## Citation Resolution

The resolver turns `[N]` markers in NotebookLM answers into clickable `[[Source#^c-XXXXXXXX|[N]]]` wikilinks. Click to jump to the exact cited passage in the source transcript.

- Anchor IDs are stable (MD5 of cited text)
- Idempotent: re-running same question skips existing anchors
- Cross-source citation remap: handles collapsed source_ids
- ~96% resolution rate across tested queries

## Examples

- **Health:** 300 Huberman episodes -> personalized health protocol with sleep, supplements, exercise experiments
- **Product:** 200 Lenny's Podcast episodes -> product strategy playbook with cited frameworks
- **New job:** Onboarding docs + team wikis + architecture decisions -> ramp-up plan with daily experiments
- **Business:** Hormozi content -> offer audit with value equation scoring
